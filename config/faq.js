    question: "What should I track?",
    answer: `That's really up to you. But, you can't go wrong tracking your 
				mood a couple times a day, and each time you drink water. From there, you'll start to see what 
				else you might want to track and understand.`
  },
  {
    question: "Can I order my trackers?",
    answer: `Tabs are hidden by default, and you cannot sort trackers on the default tab. But you can on other tabs. Turn tabs on by going to setting enabling selecting "Show Board Tabs". You can keep the same Tracker in multiple tabs.`
  },
  {
    question: "When should I track?",
    answer: `That's really up to you too, but the key is to keep it balanced, 
				track a few times throughout the day maybe?`
  },
  {
    question: `Where's my data stored?`,
    answer: `If you went with the cloud option, your data is stored encrypted in Blockstack's instance of GaiaHub. 
				The only person able to decrypt your data is you. If you picked local storage, then your data is stored 
				in the browser that's running this instance of Nomie.`
  },
  {
    question: `Can I host my own data?`,
    answer: `Yes! If you're technical search "Blockstack DigitalOcean GaiaHub" and follow the instructions.
				This will direct you to Blockstack where you'll set your own GaiaHub storage`
  },
  {
    question: `Can I auto import things into this version of Nomie?`,
    answer: `Kinda - using a custom URL parameter. If you add /?note=Hi to the end of this 
				url - it will automatically create a note. Apps like Tasker (Android) and 
				Shortcuts in iOS can open web browsers. So you url encode a note with the 
				data you need. For example: #water(34)`
  },
  {
    question: `Why create Nomie?`,
    answer: `Because I (@brandoncorbin) need it.`
